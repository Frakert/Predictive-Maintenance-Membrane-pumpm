CPP has a proxy in place, this makes it so that pip install will not work on default.
When pip install can not find an instance of a package, or has http timeout its useually the proxies fault.

To fix this proxy settings need to be set.

When in command promt(cmd) or powershell:

set HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.oce.net:81
set HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.oce.net:81

When in Anacona, edit the .condarc file or got to preferences to add:

proxy_servers:
  http: http://proxy.oce.net:81
  https: http://proxy.oce.net:81

I have yet to find a way to install packages within a compiler (like visual studio code or Spyder).
